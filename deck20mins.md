# What hurts in Design?

--
.de-em-list[

- **"Is the design done?"** How will we know?
- **"What's the most important design to work on?"** Who decides?
- **"Does this work as a design *system*?"** Is our design system intact?
- **Communicating design** to teams of mixed expertise
- **Broken process** or no process at all
]

???

- Unsustainable pace
- Changing requirements
- "Seagull" management
- Low-fidelity communication => not knowing/agreeing on what to design
- Doing unnecessary work / designing the wrong thing
- working working working and then NEVER releasing

# Origin Story

???

- started as a self-taught designer,
- found Agile and fell in love,
- because it addressed a lot of these problems


---

class: center, middle

# I witnessed Agile making engineers happy

???


- productive too

---
class: inverse, center, middle
# how does that work?

---

# Pairing enables happiness

--

- because we're social mammals
--

- fight distraction, gain focus (your pair doesn't care about your facebook page)
--

- we're already [starting to pair-design]. How do we pair *more*?

---

# Test-Driving enables pairing

--

- because it answers "what should we do now?"
--

- and "why should a client pay for two people to work on this?"
--

- ping-pong pairing

---

# so...

--

- if agile enables happiness,
--

- and pairing enables agile,
--

- and test-driven development ("TDD") enables pairing,

# How do we enable TDD for Design?

LET THIS QUESTION HANG

# Agenda

I. What are the benefits of TDD?


II. How does TDD work?


III. How could we Test-Drive Design?

---

class: center, middle, warning

## WARNING: "Testing" is a messy word.

???

- In the design context, it usually means User Testing
- User Testing is a part of this, but we're talking about a lot more

# I. The Benefits of TDD

---

class: de-em-list

## Benefits of TDD (for product)

- **Allows "done" to be defined** by non-programmers (e.g. using Gherkin "Given/When/Then" stories)
- **Fights scope creep** by preventing over-engineering. You're just trying to make this test pass.
- **Allows a constant health-check**, (i.e., Continuous integration) so you know when the app is broken. Business (not technology) decides when to ship.
- **Lowers the cost of change** so product decisions can iterated on quickly and safely

???

These are all critical to lean practice

---

class: de-em-list

##  Benefits of TDD (for teams)
- **Standardizes workflow** so as to lower bus-count risk, the cost of training, and the cost of learning new things
- **Helps any teammember quickly understand** what's going on (including new teammembers or Future You)
- **Provides live documentation** that never lies (c.f. "Comments are lies waiting to happen")
- **Allows for refactoring** (implementation changes, outcome doesn't)
- **Improves (API) interfaces and software design**, enforcing SOLID principles, Law of Demeter, etc.

???

- get away from Ninja Rock Star, towards repeatable empirical scientific methods
- "Improves design" is analogous to consistency, using a grid, etc.

# II. How does TDD work?

---
class: middle
.f3[A TDD example: ]

# Hamazon.com

???

We're going to talk about my favorite website


---

background-image: url(images/hamazon.png)

???

we'll start w/ a story

---

## Our User Story

.f2[`User should be able to add Item to Shopping Cart`]

???

- We're pairing,
- I'll write the test & you make it pass


---

### Write in Gherkin

Gherkin looks a lot like regular English, but with a few magic words:

- **"Given",**
- **"When",**
- **"And",**
- **"Then".**

---

### Write the Test

```ruby
Given I am a loggedin User
When I go to the Item Page
And I tap the "Add Item to Cart" button
Then I should see the Cart Inventory increment
And I should see the Cart Sub-Total increment
And I should see the Warehouse Inventory decrement
```

---

### Rules of Testing

- Test is readable by the computer
- Each line will fail or pass individually

---
class: center, middle
## TDD Credo: ".red[Red], .green[Green], Refactor"

---

### Write a .red[Red] Test

.green[`Given I'm a logged-in User`]

.green[`When I go to the Item Page`]

.red[`And I tap the "Add Item to Cart" button`]

???

- already written *User login*
- already written *Item Page*
- but there is no button

---

### Now make it .green[Green!]
- Go into the part of the codebase which has front-end HTML views
- find the `Item Page`
- add a `<button>Add Item to Cart</button>`

---
class: center, middle, inverse
.f1[That's it.]

???

- No mucking with the database.
- The button isn't hooked up to anything.
- just trying to make the test pass, line by line.

---
### Run the test again:

.green[`Given I'm a logged-in User`]

.green[`When I go to the Item Page`]

.green[`And I tap the "Add Item to Cart" button`]

.red[`Then I should see the Cart Inventory increment`]

---

.f3[What next?]

- connect the `<button>` to the database
- `Cart Inventory` should increment
- run the test again

---
layout:true
### Run until done

.green[`Given I'm a logged-in User`]

.green[`When I go to the Item Page`]

.green[`And I tap the "Add Item to Cart" button`]

---

.green[`Then I should see the Cart Inventory increment`]

---

.green[`Then I should see the Cart Inventory increment`]

.red[`And I should see the Cart Sub-Total increment`]

---

.green[`Then I should see the Cart Inventory increment`]

.green[`And I should see the Cart Sub-Total increment`]

.red[`And I should see the Warehouse Inventory decrement`]

---
layout: false

# The Story is Done!

???

What next?

---
class: center, middle

# Running the Test Suite

---

## Now run ALL our tests, together
- All features (e.g. Login, Item Page) have tests
- This test is .green[green], but run the Test Suite
- Did this feature break anything?

???

- take a few minutes, stretch our legs

---
class: center, middle, warning

## We broke suite!

???

- we broke part of the warehouse management system
- cheaper to fix it now

---

## Fix (& Refactor)!

- Fix (often refactor) our code
- (Write additional tests as necessary)
- Repeat until green.
- Push to production

---

class: middle, center, interlude

.f1[What's Refactoring?]

???

You might've heard the word as MysteryDevIncantation to goof off

---

.f2[Changing the .green[implementation] while maintaining the .green[outcome].]

---

class: center, middle

.f2[allows a perpetual .green[health] .red[check] for the app!]

???

**Continuous Integration** is often the delivery vector for this health check

---

## <s>F**k it,</s> Ship It!

- Mitigate technical risks
- Deployment is a purely business decision

???

this is crucial for *lean product development* & *testing hypotheses*

---

class: center, middle

.f2[.de-em[A brief note on] Types of tests]


???

- GUI, integration, unit
- tests can drive out other tests

# III. How could we <br/> Test-drive design?

???

---

name: csstest
### People are working on CSS Testing

<http://CSSTe.st> catalogs a number of techniques for testing CSS

### Tend to be focused on a few approaches

1. Screenshot Diff'ing
2. Unit Testing CSS
3. Linting

---

### 1. Screenshot Diff'ing

.de-em[Examples using [Wraith][wraith] and [CSS Critic][csscritic]]

.left-column[![](images/wraith.png)]
.right-column[
![](images/css-critic.png)
]

---

### 2. Unit Testing CSS
.de-em[example using [Hardy.io][hardy]]

```ruby
Feature: Website layout test
As a user I want visual consistency on the http://csste.st/ website

Scenario: Content layout
Given I visit "http://csste.st/"
Then "section > p" should have "color" of "rgb(68, 68, 68)"
```

---

### 3. Linting
.de-em[example using [CSS Lint][csslint]]

![](images/csslint.png)

???
could be a good health check

---

class: center, middle
### These are all very practical and tactical

---

class: center, middle
### What's missing?

---

class: middle, center, inverse

.f1[Design!]

???

- These are concerned with testing CSS rather than testing *design*.

---
class: center, middle, greenbg

# Test *DESIGN*, not just implementation
???

- these steps are crucial
- necessary but not sufficient

---
name:methodology
class: center, middle, inverse

# Methodology of TDDesign

<!-- this could be a place for# <Interlude>: TDD & Pairing -->
<!-- this could be a place for# <Interlude>: Ping Pong Pairing -->

???

So what's the design equivalent?

---
class: center, middle

## What would the Literal Interpretation for TDDesign look like?

???

- we looked at Automated design testing tools earlier
- can we test-DRIVE with them?

---

### Image Diff test-driving

- Red Test: Mockup vs. Screenshot of implementation
- Green Test: Image diff passes

Worth it? Maybe for responsive or X-browser? Style-Guide Driven Design?

???

---

### Unit-Testing CSS test-driving

- Hardy, Quixote, Cactus, etc. could do this
- Tedious to write the tests
- what's the correlation between Design Decisions and CSS rules?

Worth it? Sometimes, especially to protect against regressions

---

### Linting

- Not sure that test-driving applies at all

???
- style-guide driven design
- [Stylecop][] can ensure compliance with [hologram][]
- Pivotal Labs is doing some very cool work right now w/ PUI

---

### UX: Including the user
- Persona.yml
- UserTesting.com, Ethn.io
- Lean Hypotheses

???

- Persona.yml makes personae Acceptance Criteria
- UserTesting.com, Ethn.io could be ways to automate via machine
- Hypotheses set up acceptance crit

## To go from "Testing" to "Test Driving", ask

.f2["(How) can this plug into an Automated .green[Health] .red[Check]?"]

- socialize the notion of a transparent heath check
- team agrees on, done means done
